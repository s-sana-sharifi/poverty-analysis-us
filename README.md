## Overview

This project uses publicly available US census-style datasets (2015) to explore the correlation between:

- Educational attainment (high school completion)
- Median household income
- Race/ethnic composition
- Poverty rate across US states

Data was cleaned, merged, and analyzed using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
